manifest2description - create mod_autoindex descriptions from MANIFEST

DESCRIPTION
    In apache2 you can add descriptions to the htaccess file, for example-
    and they will show up in your directory listing when you have
    mod_autoindex enabled.

    The idea ocurred since in the MANIFEST you already place descriptions,
    if you want, and sometimes one keeps content backed up under revission
    control with a MANIFEST.

USAGE
    manifest2description [OPTIONS]..

       -h          help
       -t          test entries in manifest for existence in docroot
       -b path     path to where entries will appear this is
                   likely ENV DOCUMENT_ROOT, only used with -t
                   this has priority over the environment variable DOCUMENT_ROOT

  USAGE EXAMPLES
       cat MANIFEST | manifest2description >> ~/public_html/.htaccess

       manifest2description MANIFEST

       manifest2description -t MANIFEST # will require DOCUMENT_ROOT env to be set

       # will not require DOCUMENT_ROOT env to be set, takes priority:
       manifest2description -t -b /home/myself/public_html MANIFEST 

    Example manifest input:

       images - image directory
       docs - publicly available documents
       docs/instructions.txt - instructions
       item

    If an entry has no description, does not output. If you don't use the -t
    test flag, then we don't test for existence. If it doesn't exist, the
    entry is skipped, we warn, continue, and exit with value.
